âœ…Approach:
Initialization: Start with score = 0.
Loop Through the String: Use a loop that runs from the first to the second last character.
Calculate and Update: In each iteration of the loop, calculate the absolute difference between the current character and the next character, and add this difference to score.
Return the Score: After the loop, return the accumulated score.

C++ Code

class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfString(string s) {
        int score = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            score += abs(s[i] - s[i + 1]);
        }
        return score;
    }
};
